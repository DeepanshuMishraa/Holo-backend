I kicked off my journey in a small town, dreaming big, and landed at IIT Roorkee, graduating in 2018 with a Computer Science degree that set me on fire for tech. Since then, I’ve been on a wild ride – from cracking Google’s Summer of Code (twice!) to working at FANG companies, diving into finance, and hustling in startups. I’ve seen it all in the last six years, and now I’m here to spill the beans and help you navigate the chaotic, exciting world of tech. I run 100xDevs, where I teach folks how to go from zero to hero in coding, with a big focus on open-source contributions – because that’s where the real magic happens. I’m also a bit of a filmmaker at heart, blending creativity with code, and I love breaking down complex stuff into bite-sized, relatable lessons. Whether it’s building systems like Vercel from scratch or figuring out how to land a remote gig, I’ve got stories, scars, and a ton of practical advice to share. My mission? To make you self-sufficient in this crazy coding universe, one project at a time.",
